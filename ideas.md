# ideas

add a new sense to a human body in a non-intrusive manner (aka no neural implants or surgery required)

## general

- use an existing sense to send all data to the brain
- human senses:
  - sight
  - taste
  - touch
  - pressure (different from touch)
  - itch (different from touch)
  - thermoception (heat transfer)
  - sound
  - smell
  - proprioception (limb positions)
  - tension sensors (in muscles)
  - nociception (pain)
  - equilibrioception (body acceleration and directionnal changes)
  - stretch receptors (in lungs and digestive track)
  - chemoreceptors
  - thirst (let me get some water)
  - hunger
  - magnetoception (more present with birds)
  - time
- probably sight through sound
- use hilbert cuve
- probably black and white

## sight advantages

- extensible
- could be changed to: infrared, ultraviolet, 360Â° vision...
- could represent anything that can be viewed as a 2d image

## sound advantages

- unfortunately used for something else (hearing)
- only 1-dimensionnal (use of hilbert curve)
- most precise sense after sight (can't use sight to add sight)
- two completely different channels could be sent through 2 ears
